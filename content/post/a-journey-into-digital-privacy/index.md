This is a brief blog post about my friends' and my journey into digital privacy, and how to achieve some of it by simply changing a few settings, or with the help of publicly available and open source tools.

This is in no way a complete guide on how to become completely anonymous on the web or whatever, but more like an introduction towards what you can do to gain a little bit of digital privacy back, as well as to protect yourself a little better from potential outside threats (like e.g. malware, or simply annoying ads).

## Browsers

Our journey begins with our browser – our gateway to the internet, and our most favorite program by far. We use it every day, but we never (or very rarely) even stop to think about what information our browser is giving to all those different websites we visit (yes, even in incognito mode).



#### Check your Browser now!

There are many online tools out there to figure out what and how much information your browser is giving away, but these URLs might be a good start for you:

* [BrowserAudit](https://browseraudit.com/)
* [BrowserLeaks](https://browserleaks.com/)
* [Do I Leak](https://www.doileak.com/)



#### Settings

Did you ever take the time to review your browser's settings? Like seriously taking your time and trying to understand what every option does?

One of the most basic and easiest things you can do on your browser's settings is to **set your browser to delete Cookies after every session** close. [Here](https://ccm.net/faq/32792-google-chrome-automatically-clear-cookies-after-each-browsing-session) is a brief article that explains how to do it on Chrome. The process should be fairly similar for other browsers nowadays too. If not, google it.



#### Extensions / Addons

One of our favorite Extensions is **[uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock)** (not to be confused with [uBlock](https://www.reddit.com/r/ublock/comments/32mos6/ublock_vs_ublock_origin/)). It is our go-to-Extension for content-filtering and ad-blocking (*"it is a wide-spectrum blocker"*).

We recommend checking out the following URLs for potential content-filters that you want to use:

* [FilterLists](https://filterlists.com/)
* [Block List Project](https://blocklist.site/)

But if you are more that "one-click-make-it-work" type of person, then the [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/) might be for you – though it is more focused on blocking some third-party trackers only. Nonetheless, there are thousands of other tools out there which might better adapt to your needs – start googling!

## Mac Settings

Go to your System Preferences, Security & Privacy, and please review all your settings.

Most of the time I use Mac, but the general rules are:<span> 

* Your Firewall should definitely be on. 
* If you travel a lot, or somebody else uses your laptop too, turn on FileVault (or device encryption). 
* And please (please) [use a strong password](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/how-to-create-a-strong-password) for your Mac.

## Search Engines

What better search engine than Google? Google is your friend – you can find almost anything nowadays through that search engine. (However, please don't believe everything you find and see online. Be a critical thinker – even towards this little blog post.)

Even though Google is amazing and helps you find things online quickly and (most of the time) accurately, it still tracks a lot (really a lot) of the things you do online (and sometimes even *offline*). And if you do not want Google knowing that you curiously searched for *"Is watermelon a cucumber?"* at 2am, then you might be better off with **[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)**.

## Advertising, Ads Everywhere

<span style="color:#f8f8f2;">Do you want to opt-out of personalized advertising? The following URLs show you which  companies might gather or even already own some of your data and how to opt-out from personalized advertising:</span>

## Disclaimer

Don't forget that any changes to your settings, and any tools/programs that you download on your device will have some sort of consequences. For example: when filtering content or blocking cookies, you cannot use several functionalities and/or features of some websites – like e.g. Facebook. Additionally, some changes in your settings might prevent you from using other tools or websites. Therefore, when changing anything you are not really sure about: *baby steps*.

You are responsible of figuring out what the best balance is for your online experience, and how much digital privacy you want to achieve. Though I hope that this brief blog post has helped some of you become more conscious about your online behavior, maybe even motivated or inspired some of you to learn more about IT. There are thousands of tools and ways out there to improve your digital privacy and security – go for it (if you are curious)!
