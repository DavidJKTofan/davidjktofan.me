Welcome to a brief introduction to [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).

## What is Cloudflare Workers

_Cloudflare Workers is a serverless application platform running on Cloudflare's global cloud network in over 200 cities around the world, offering both free and paid plans._

Developer Docs: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/

Some of the advantages of Cloudflare Workers are:

- Dynamically respond to requests without needing to connect to an origin server at all
- Perform data sanitization and validation before sending a request to your origin
- Generate parallel requests to different services and combine the responses
- Your code runs within milliseconds of your users worldwide
- Say goodbye to cold starts‚Äîsupport for 0ms worldwide

However, convince yourself of it's power and usefulness by trying it out yourself...

## Our First Project

We will create a Cloudflare Workers which returns/renders a dynamic HTML response/page based on where the user visiting our site is in the world.

Here the final [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/DavidJKTofan/html-my-project) of our first project.
And below, the steps to follow:

### Setup

Install and/or update `npm` on your computer:
```
npm install -g npm
```    

Install Cloudflare Command-line (Wrangler):
```
npm install -g @cloudflare/wrangler
```

Check if Wrangler has been installed and it is the latest version:
```
wrangler --version
```

Connect Wrangler with your Cloudflare account (option 1):
```
wrangler login
```

_NOTE: if you don't have a Cloudflare account yet, [click here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)¬†‚Äì it's FREE!_

If the login process does not proceed as intended, you can manually add your API Token here (option 2):
```
wrangler config
```

Alternatively, go into the Wrangler CONFIG file and add your `account_id` (option 3):
```
cd PROJECT_NAME
sudo nano wrangler.toml
```

_NOTE: you can find your API Tokens and Keys [here](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200167836-Managing-API-Tokens-and-Keys)._

Make sure you are logged in:
```
wrangler whoami
```

### Generate Project

Generate first project (which will generate a folder with some files inside):
```
wrangler generate PROJECT_NAME
```

Now the fun part is that we will create a [`template.js`](https://github.com/DavidJKTofan/html-my-project/blob/master/template.js) file with some code for a landing page.

In the main `index.js` file we will have to call `import template from './template'`¬†‚Äì in order to call our `template.js` ‚Äì, as well as set `template(request.cf)` as the new Response body. Additionally, change the `content-type` to `text/html;charset=UTF-8`.

The `index.js` file should look like this:
```
import template from './template'

addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

async function handleRequest(request) {
  return new Response(template(request.cf), {        // body
    headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html;charset=UTF-8' },  // init
  })
}
```

Allow import other modules and `npm` packages on Workers by changing the type in the `wrangler.toml` file:
```
type = "webpack"
```

In order to use country code emojis, install this package:
```
npm i country-code-emoji
```

The `template.js` file should look like this:
```
import flag from 'country-code-emoji'

const template = cf => {
    const emoji = flag(cf.country) || "üëãüèª"

    return `
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html lang="en">
        <head>
          <meta charset="utf-8" />
          <meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="ie=edge" />
          <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
          <title>Hello!</title>
          <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/modern-css-reset/dist/reset.min.css" />
          <style>
            body {
              background: #eee;
              display: flex;
              align-items: center;
              justify-content: center;
              min-height: 100vh;
              font-family: sans-serif;
            }
            div.container {
              background: #fff;
              border-radius: 1rem;
              padding: 4rem;
            }
          </style>
        </head>
        <body>
          <div class="container">
            <h1>Hello there! You're connecting from ${cf.city} in ${cf.country} ${emoji}</h1>
          </div>
        </body>
      </html>
      `
  }

export default template
```

_NOTE: you can choose different [IncomingRequestCfProperties](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/request#incomingrequestcfproperties) instead of `cf.country`, such as `cf.colo` or `cf.city`._

Preview the project:
```
wrangler preview
```

Production:
```
wrangler dev
```

Publish our project to Cloudflare:
```
wrangler publish
```
