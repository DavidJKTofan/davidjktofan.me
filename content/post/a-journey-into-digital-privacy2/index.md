This is a brief blog post about my friends' and my journey into digital privacy, and how to achieve some of it by simply changing a few settings, or with the help of publicly available and open source tools.

## Browsers

Our journey begins with our browser â€“ our gateway to the internet, and our most favorite program by far. We use it every day, but we never (or very rarely) even stop to think about what information our browser is giving to all those different websites we visit (yes, even in incognito mode).

#### Check your Browser now!

There are many online tools out there to figure out what and how much information your browser is giving away, but these URLs might be a good start for you:

* [BrowserAudit](https://browseraudit.com/)
* [BrowserLeaks](https://browserleaks.com/)
* [Do I Leak](https://www.doileak.com/)

#### Settings

Have you ever taking the time to review your browser's settings? Like seriously taking your time and trying to understand what every option does?

One of the most basic and easiest things you can do on your browser's settings is to **set your browser to delete Cookies after every session** close. [Here](https://ccm.net/faq/32792-google-chrome-automatically-clear-cookies-after-each-browsing-session) is a brief article that explains how to do it on Chrome. The process should be fairly similar for other browsers nowadays too.

#### Extensions / Addons

One of my favorite Extensions is **[uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock)** (not to be confused with [uBlock](https://www.reddit.com/r/ublock/comments/32mos6/ublock_vs_ublock_origin/)). It is my go-to-Extension for content-filtering and ad-blocking (*it is a wide-spectrum blocker*).

I recommend checking out the following URLs for potential content-filters that you want to use:

* [FilterLists](https://filterlists.com/)
* [Block List Project](https://blocklist.site/)

But if you are more that "one-click-make-it-work" type of person, then the [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/) might be for you. Nonetheless, there are thousands of other tools out there which might better adapt to your needs.
