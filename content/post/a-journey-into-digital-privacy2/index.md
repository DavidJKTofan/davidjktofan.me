## Browser Settings

Our journey begins with our browser â€“ our gateway to the internet, and our most favorite program by far. We use it every day, but we never (or very rarely) even stop to think about what information our browser is giving all those different websites we visit (yes, even in incognito mode).

#### Extensions / Addons

One of my favorite Extensions is [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) (not to be confused with [uBlock](https://www.reddit.com/r/ublock/comments/32mos6/ublock_vs_ublock_origin/)). It is my go-to-Extension for content-filtering and ad-blocking (*it is a wide-spectrum blocker*).

I recommend checking out the following URLs for potential content-filters that you want to use:

* [FilterLists](https://filterlists.com/)
* [Block List Project](https://blocklist.site/)
