## Phishing

_"“Phishing” refers to an attempt to steal sensitive information, typically in the form of usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, bank account information or other important data in order to utilize or sell the stolen information."_

There are several different types of phishing attacks, but ultimately they all want to steal important information.
A great introduction can be found on this article from Cloudflare:

-   [What is a phishing attack?](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/phishing-attack/)

## Recognize Phishing attacks

### Emails

Be on the look out for these warning signs:

* Several grammar mistakes
* General greeting ("Dear,", "Hi Kontakt", "Hello Sir"...)
* Very complex and/or long email sender

These are only a few warning signs that the email you received might (or might not) be a phishing attempt.

Generally, a good practice is that when you receive an email from e.g. LinkedIn or your Bank, you do not open any link from those emails, but go on your browser, open a new tab and login to your account in a normal way to check for any notifications or such.

### Phone Calls


## Reporting

When you become a target of a phishing attack or any type of scam, first and foremost, protect yourself and your close ones. However, the entire Internet community would appreciate it if you help report such attacks too.

Reporting is easier and faster than one thinks, and the entire Internet could benefit from it.

### Browsers

#### Chrome

If you encounter a website that tries to scam people or steal personal information, you can submit a report to Google, who will then review your report and potentially block the website on all Google Chrome browsers:

#### Firefox

If you are using Firefox, you can use the following process to submit a report:

1. Select Help > Report Deceptive Site
2. Paste the URL of the phishing site
3. Click I am not a robot
4. Submit Report

### Abuse Email

If you want to directly contact the Domain provider, you can use this method by writing in your terminal:

    whois URL.COM

Now look for the "Abuse" email and write them a quick email about the phishing website. In most cases they will handle it quickly.

### Hosting Providers

In some cases you might want to contact the hosting provider of the website directly. You can use these websites to check who their hosting provider is:

-   [Hosting Checker](https://hostingchecker.com/)
-   [Who Is Hosting This](https://www.whoishostingthis.com/)

Afterward, you'd have to go to the hosting provider's website and figure out their abuse or report processes. Sometimes you can even just write them a quick message on their support chat.

### National Authorities

Additionally, for more serious cases, you can also report cybercrime to national authorities. Some of these can be found here:
